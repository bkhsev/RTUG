## Why bother?  :grimacing:
Russian Ruble is a soft currency. Therefore, in the long-run it experiences devaluation. :chart_with_downwards_trend:	

> A **soft currency** is one with a value that fluctuates, predominantly lower, as a result of the country's political or economic uncertainty. 

If you are interested in buying stocks on russian stock market, devaluation makes it difficult to find businesses that are worth investing in.

### [Rosneft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosneft "Wikipedia") (Ticker: ROSN)

#### Below is a graph of ROSN in Russian Ruble. 
It is apparent that the firm has been growing and generally has a positive growth trend. :+1:

So, stock charts in RUB (Russian Ruble) are usually misleading about the quality of the business. 

RTUG helps you visualise a more realistic picture.
